# ViRep
Python/QT implementation of the viral replication cellular automaton as defined under https://www.hermetic.ch/pca/algorithms.htm#vr.

This program was part of my final exam assignment in high school informatics.
Documentation (in German): https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UztN-_t0zBk4PZ8AhLlTmMDYQ_e15day3t7caa4e0j4

Version 1.0 uses the PyQT module. Version 1.1 uses the PyQT and PyQWT modules. These need to be installed for the code to run without errors.
