# ViRep
Python/QT implementation of the viral replication cellular automaton as defined under https://www.hermetic.ch/pca/algorithms.htm#vr
This program was part of my final exam assignment in high school informatics.

Version 1.0 uses the PyQT module. Version 1.1 uses the PyQT and PyQWT modules. These need to be installed for the code to run without errors.
